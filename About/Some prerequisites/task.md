Welcome to the course in Fundamentals of Machine Learning!

#### Course aims

The provided materials offer examples of writing programs utilizing methods of machine learning in solving a variety of tasks. Each assignment is preceded by a brief theory excerpt; however, in order to get a comprehensive understanding of the mathematical basis of the described processes, you should refer to additional materials. You can find them, for example, [here](http://www.machinelearning.ru/).

#### Prerequisites

The course describes step-by-step problem solutions with a variety of approaches. However, we assume that you already have certain knowledge of:
 * Python basics â€“ you can learn it in [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/onboarding/?track=python) or take the course [Introduction to Python](https://stepik.org/course/238/promo).
 * Linear algebra basics. In the course, you will encounter formulas like this: 
 $$ {\mu_{c} = \frac{\sum\limits_{j=1,\dots, n} [c_i = c] x_i^j}{\sum\limits_{c_i = c} 1} } $$
 In case of any difficulties, we recommend that you study the respective topics.
