Search of similar images, face and object recognition – these are examples of machine learning tasks. They are used in various spheres: from entertainment to medical diagnostics.

### [Text analysis](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%83%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7_%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0)
For example, one of the tasks — [sentiment analysis](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7_%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8_%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0) — is to figure out whether the feedback is positive or negative.
Other tasks involve identifying threats or fraud in texts, which is used by corporate or federal security services.

### Sound analysis
Another use of ML is [speech recognition](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%B8). Here, possible tasks are similar to those in text analysis: identifying tone, fake detection, etc.
Besides, there are some specific tasks, like [voice recognition](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%BF%D0%BE_%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%83) used in control systems or sound-based malfunction detection (e.g., in engines).

### Video analysis
Video motion detection is used both in the computer games industry and in security systems.

### Brain signal analysis
Another interesting example of using machine learning algorithms is decoding speech from neural signals received from the cortex via the non-invasive method of magnetoencephalography (MEG). This approach may allow restoring verbal communication capacity in patients with the locked-in syndrome (when a person is paralyzed but conscious). An example of using this method is described in this article.


### Other uses

Among them: [time series analysis](http://www.machinelearning.ru/wiki/index.php?title=%D0%92%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B4), log analysis, detecting vulnerabilities, resource planning, and economic analysis, i.e., any kind of data analysis that goes beyond descriptions with simple algorithms becomes a use field of ML.
One more commonly familiar example of ML use is recommendations (ad targeting, movie and show recommendations on such platforms like Netflix or Kinopoisk).
