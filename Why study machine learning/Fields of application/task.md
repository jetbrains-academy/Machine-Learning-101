## Fields of Application

### [Computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision)

Search of similar images, face and object recognition – these are examples of machine learning tasks. They are used in various spheres: from entertainment to medical diagnostics.

### [Text analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining)
For example, one of the tasks — [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) — is to figure out whether the feedback is positive or negative.
Other tasks involve identifying threats or fraud in texts, which is used by corporate or federal security services.

### Sound analysis
Another use of ML is [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition). Here, possible tasks are similar to those in text analysis: identifying tone, fake detection, etc.
Besides, there are some specific tasks, like [speaker recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_recognition) used in control systems or sound-based malfunction detection (e.g., in engines).

### Video analysis
Video motion detection is used both in the computer games industry and in security systems.

### Brain signal analysis
Another interesting example of using machine learning algorithms is decoding speech from neural signals received from the cortex via the non-invasive method of magnetoencephalography (MEG). This approach may allow restoring verbal communication capacity in patients with the locked-in syndrome (when a person is paralyzed but conscious). An example of using this method is described in [this article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00290/full).


### Other uses

Among them: [time series analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series), log analysis, detecting vulnerabilities, resource planning, and economic analysis, i.e., any kind of data analysis that goes beyond descriptions with simple algorithms becomes a use field of ML.
One more commonly familiar example of ML use is recommendations (ad targeting, movie and show recommendations on platforms like Netflix).
