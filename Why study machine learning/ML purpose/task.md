### Application
There are two different branches of [machine learning](http://www.machinelearning.ru/wiki/index.php?title=%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5http://www.machinelearning.ru/wiki/index.php?title=%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5) (ML):
- academic — studying the possibilities and application areas of ML algorithms;
- practical — applying the existing algorithms in a certain field.

ML is used in solving problems that require processing huge amounts of data, as well as in cases that allow learning while solving multiple analogous tasks.

Among other things, ML allows performing such operations as predictive modeling, automation of decision-making, and expert knowledge formalization.

The number of such tasks is rapidly growing in the today's world. What accounts for it is the increasing automation process, as well as the necessity of analyzing the growing amounts of data in theoretical and practical spheres where the conventional mathematical models of formalization cannot be applied.


### Application specifics
Note that machine learning should not be applied in tasks that may be easily solved with a deterministic algorithm.

If a deterministic solution is impossible or time-consuming, it becomes crucial to choose the right class of a ML task. The next step on a ML solution involves studying examples of solving tasks of this particular type.
